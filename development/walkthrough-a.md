Welcome to the first lesson in our code-along Capstone series, where together, we'll be building the Weatherful weather application interface. 

By this point you've completed the first few lessons, introducing you to the basics of HTML and CSS. In those lessons, I've been slowly walking you through the development of a project, along with teaching the concepts and code required to bring that to life - step by step.

This Weatherful project is a little different than the one we've been working, and will continue to work on, for those lessons: 
- Of course, it's a different project, so different interface and design, different requirements
- But what I *think* you'll really find most interesting is seeing the development process from a developers perspective.
   - And while I'll be explaining everythign I do as I'm going along, I'll be walking through parts of the development in a much longer sprint - mostly focusing on reenforcing the skills you've just learned in the lessons, or showing you new techniques for applying them
   
<!-- 
Of course, you'll have the opportunity to see a whole new concept and design - and this design is specifically is a lot lighter on the text content, and that's going to create an opportunity to show you some new ways to implement some of the same techniques. So although I'll be exapanding on *some* of the topics covered in the lessons that preceed the capstone, we'll primarily treat each part of this project - which you'll watch at the END of each module - as an applied summary of everything you've covered in the lessons immediately before. 

 Because I'll be walking through parts of the development in a much longer sprint. So you can code along if you feel comfortable, or maybe watch it through once and challenge yourself to try coding some aspects of this without the instruction running in the background - but whichever way you choose, I'm glad you're here and hope you're excited to embark on this projcet along with me.
 -->

So this project is split-up into 5 lessons including this one. The FOUR upcoming lesson are all code-alongs, each of which will take on the code concepts that are particular to what you've just learned in that module.

Although we already know enough HTML to lay the groundwork for this project, in THIS lessons, we're actually not going to write any code together. 
   - Instead, we'll spend our time walking through the project's requirements and reverse-enginnnering the finshed interface, to help you better understand how to THINK like a developer, but also sharpening your eye for design, and allowing you to better undersatnd how a project comes together, from both side, start to finish.

<!-- * In this video I'm going to introduce you to our capstone project. We're also going to:
    * Breakdown the parts of the project to help you think a littel more like a developer
    * Talk through the stages we'll cover through the upcoming course modules, each of which will walk you through a part of this interface's development -->

## Overview of Parts

- Let's get started by walking through what this project is going to look like when we're done
   - Here I'm using a preview tool built into Chrome that makes it easier to show you this design in various sizes
      - Of course, I haven't shown you this tool yet, but we'll be covering how to use these Developer Tools in an upcoming lesson

- Here's what the project looks like when it's in it's slimmest layout - some people refer to this as "mobile" view.
   - 


## Features (data)

    * [Screencast] Give a high-level demo of the Weatherful project
        * Show device responsive design (maybe pop-out inspector as its own window and just use the viewport resizing capability)
        * Show how the design responds to different cities' (do **not** show *how* to change the data at this point) weather conditions
        * Talk about how the layout is driven by data, but again stay out of the weeds on this
    * By the end of this course, you'll have built your own version of Weatherful from scratch! All of the design implementation, through structure, style, and functional code. That might seem really far away from where we're starting right now, but let's start to work through how we're going to get from a blank page to an interactive interface.

## Breakdown into HTML



## Responsive layout
- Magic!


* Let's start by breaking down some of the pages in Weatherful…
    * [Slides] Break down images of design.
        * Build up a document outline based on the screenshots.
        * Step the outline into pseudo code for the main elements.
    * [Slides] Walk through the style guide and how developers consider those elements

* [Slides] Now that we're thinking about this project like a developer, let's also consider what we don't know yet, but will need to know to complete Weatherful.
    * We need to create a layout with the correct spacing and sizing.
        * I mentioned that table earlier, so we'll need to learn how to make a data table and populate it.
        * We saw when examining our style sheet that we need to deal with a lot of typography details and also implement gradients and patterns.
        * We'll be tackling all of these tasks and more following Module B.
    * Another big consideration is that the design has to be responsive so that it looks as good when it's scaled up on a laptop or desktop computer.
        * We also need to deal with those menus that run horizontally instead of vertically.
        * There's a lot of other details to get this design just right, including how and when particular elements are displayed and things like hover states.
        * We'll finish polishing the page design and dealing with our responsive needs at the end of Module C.
    * [Breakdown of Module D and E not provided]

* Wrap up the lesson and contextualize how impressive and challenging this project is for a beginner to take on and complete.
    * When you're done you'll have something great to show off.
    * Remember, you're in the driver's seat in this course and you can choose how you want to take on this project…
        * You can code along with me by watching the screencast accompanying each stage of the project.
        * You can try to work through the list of tasks on your own and only check the videos when you get stuck.
        * You're also provided solution code for each project stage, but don't use that as your first resort when stuck!
